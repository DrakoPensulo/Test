namesdao Ranking.

1) The algorithm generally ranks shorter names higher than longer ones. 
2) In general, names without leading underscore are ranked higher than these with one underscore. These, in turn, are generally ranked higher then names with 3 leading underscores.
3) Names like name111, _name111, and ___name111 are always ranked in that order. 
4) It is rather suprising (and not intentional) that the name chianet is second highest in the rank (after the only one 4 letters long name - bram).
5) Adding small number of new names should not change the ranking significantly - ranking should stay stable under normal circumstances. 
6) Adding large number of new names may change the order siginificantly, but doing so is expensive.

Description of the method TBA.
