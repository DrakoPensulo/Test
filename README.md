namesdao Ranking.

1) The algorithm generally ranks shorter names higher than longer ones. 
2) In general, names without leading underscore are ranked higher than these with one underscore. These, in turn, are generally ranked higher then names with 3 leading underscores.
3) Names like name111, _name111, and ___name111 are always ranked in that order. 
4) It is rather suprising (and not intentional) that the name chianet is highest in the rank.

Description of the method TBA.
